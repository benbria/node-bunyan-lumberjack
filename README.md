[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/bunyan-lumberjack.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/bunyan-lumberjack/)

What is it?
===========

bunyan-lumberjack is a stream for [Bunyan](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan) which takes in
Bunyan logs and writes the results to Logstash via the lumberjack protocol (used by
[logstash-forwarder](https://github.com/elasticsearch/logstash-forwarder)).

Features
========

* Logs are encrypted on the wire using TLS/SSL.
* Auto-reconnect.
* Logs are queued while disconnected, to minimize the chances any logs are lost during a disconnect.
* Intelligent dropping of messages.
* Generated entries in logstash are identical to what would be produced by
  [bunyan-logstash-tcp](https://github.com/chris-rock/bunyan-logstash-tcp), making it easy to
  switch from one to the other.

There are alternatives to this package if you don't need/want encryption:

* [bunyan-logstash-tcp](https://github.com/chris-rock/bunyan-logstash-tcp) - sends logs over TCP transport.
  Logs can be encrypted.  Logs sent while disconnected are dropped.
* [bunyan-logstash](https://github.com/sheknows/bunyan-logstash) - sends logs over UDP transport.
  Logs are not encrypted.  Logs may be lost because UDP is not reliable.

Installation
============

    npm install --save bunyan-lumberjack

Usage
=====

See [below](#tutorial) for a
complere end-to-end setup, but the basics are:

    var bunyanLumberjackStream = require('bunyan-lumberjack');

    var log = bunyan.createLogger({
        name: "myLog",
        streams: [{
            level:  'info',
            type:   'raw',
            stream: bunyanLumberjackStream({
                tlsOptions: {host: 'logstash.mycorp.com', port: 5000},
                lumberjackOptions: {
                    allowDrop: function(logEntry) {
                        // If we have to drop logs, drop INFO level logs and lower - keep errors.
                        return logEntry.level <= bunyan.INFO
                    }
                }
            })
        }]
    });

Options
=======

### tlsOptions

You can pass anything here that you would normally pass to
[`tls.connect()`](http://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_options_callback).  You probably
want to pass `host`, `port`, and if you're using a self-signed certificate, `ca`.  See the
[the tutorial](#tutorial) for a
concrete example.

If you're having problems connecting, have a look at the
[lumberjack-proto troubleshooting section](https://github.com/benbria/node-lumberjack-protocol/blob/master/README.md#troubleshooting).

### lumberjackOptions

Any option that can be passed to [lumberjack-proto](https://github.com/benbria/node-lumberjack-proto)
can be passed here.

Note that `lumberjackOptions.allowDrop` is passed a lumberjack data frame; this will have a
`line` field, which is the JSON string to be sent to logstash, a `host` field, and a `bunyanLevel` field.

### tags

An array of tags to use in the logstash log entry.  Defaults to `['bunyan']`.

### appName

The name to use for the application in the `source` field.  Defaults to `process.title`.

### type

If specified, will be added to the entry before being sent to logstash.  Defaults to 'json'.

Tutorial
========

This explains how to set up logstash and bunyan-lumberjack to work together.  This assumes you have
a [working logstash server up and running](http://www.thedreaming.org/2014/11/21/docker-logstash/).

### Create a Certificate

First, we need a certificate and private key on the logstash server.  You can generate a self-signed
certificate:

    $ sudo mkdir -p /etc/logstash/ssl
    $ sudo openssl req -new -nodes -x509 \
      -subj "/C=CA/ST=Onatrio/L=Ottawa/O=IT/CN=logstash.mycompany.com" \
      -days 3650 -keyout /etc/logstash/ssl/lumberjack.key \
      -out /etc/logstash/ssl/lumberjack.crt -extensions v3_ca
    $ sudo chmod 700 /etc/logstash/ssl/lumberjack.key

Note that the `CN` above *MUST* be the host name you pass to `bunyan-lumberjack` via
`tlsOptions.host` or else `bunyan-lumberjack` will not be able to connect.  You can't use an IP
here.  See the
[lumberjack-proto troubleshooting section](https://github.com/benbria/node-lumberjack-proto/blob/master/README.md#troubleshooting)
for more details and workarounds.

If your logstash server is not running as root, make sure it has read access to lumberjack.key
(but this is a secret key, so try to limit who has access to it.)

Also note that while a self-signed certificate is usually not trustworthy, here it will be because
we're going to copy the self-signed certificate to the client - the client won't connect to just
any self-signed certificate.

### Configure Logstash

The simple way to do this is to add this to the `input` section of logstash.conf:

    lumberjack {
        codec => json
        port => 5000
        ssl_certificate => "/etc/logstash/ssl/logstash.crt"
        ssl_key => "/etc/logstash/ssl/logstash.key"
    }

Here the `codec` must be set to `json` to work correctly with `bunyan-lumberjack`.

Alternatively, by default bunyan-lumberjack will set the `type` to 'json', so if you want to be
able to share a single lumberjack input for multiple different types of logs:

    input {
        lumberjack {
            port => 5000
            ssl_certificate => "/opt/ssl/logstash.crt"
            ssl_key => "/opt/ssl/logstash.key"
        }
    }

    filter {
        if [type] == "json" {
            json {
                source => "message"
            }
        }

        if [type] == "syslog" {
            grok {
                match => { "message" => "%{SYSLOGLINE}" }
            }
        }

        # Other filters go here...
    }


### The Client

On the client side, we need a copy of the `logstash.crt` file we just created, then:

    var fs = require('fs');
    var bunyan = require('bunyan');
    var bunyanLumberjackStream = require('bunyan-lumberjack');

    outStream = bunyanLumberjackStream({
        tlsOptions: {
            host: 'logstash.mycorp.com',
            port: 5000,
            ca: [fs.readFileSync('path/to/logstash.crt', {encoding: 'utf-8'})]
        }
    });

    outStream.on('connect', function() {
        console.log("Connected!");
    });
    outStream.on('dropped', function(count) {
        console.log("ERROR: Dropped " + count + " messages!");
    });
    outStream.on('disconnect', function(err) {
        console.log("WARN : Disconnected", err);
    });

    var log = bunyan.createLogger({
        name: "myLog",
        streams: [{level: 'info', type: 'raw', stream: outStream}]
    });

    log.info("This should work!");
